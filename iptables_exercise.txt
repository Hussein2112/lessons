You have two machines. On one of the machines, We will make changes to the 
firewall rules using iptables.

1- Stop the firewall as we will use iptables instead for now.
systemctl stop firewalld
systemctl mask firewalld


2- List your iptables rules:
iptables -L -n


3- Save the current rules to a file:
iptables-save > iptables.out


4- Empty/Flush the rules:
iptables -F

5- Confirm that all the rules are flushed and you can only see empty Chains:
iptables -L -n

Note the default policy for the INPUT chain is "ACCEPT"

-->ssh from another machine to this one:
You should be able to as the default Policy for the INPUT chain is ACCEPT.
This will work as long as sshd is running on the remote machine.


6- Now change the default policy for INPUT to DROP
iptables -P INPUT DROP

7- List the policies to confirm that INPUT policy is set to DROP
   iptables -L -n


8- Add RELATED and ESTABLISHED for ports 80,443,22. Then test ssh and http. 
   Didn't work for me!
   #iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dport 80,443,22 -m conntrack --ctstat RELATED,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT

9- NOW add the following rule "NEW" for the above ports.
   #iptables -A INPUT -p tcp -m multiport --dport 80,443,22 -m conntrack --ctstat NEW,ESTABLISHED -j ACCEPT
   Now, your ssh and http and https should work.
This, proves to me that the NEW entry is required for the access to work.
