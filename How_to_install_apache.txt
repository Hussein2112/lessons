How to install Apache on Centos 7

Introduction
Apache is a Linux application for running web servers. It is part of the LAMP stack – a package of applications that form the basis for most web technology. LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MyPHP, and PHP.
This tutorial will show you how to install and configure the Apache web server on CentOS 7.


Installing Apache on CentOS
Step 1: Update Software Versions List
Ensure you are using the latest versions of the software. 
In a terminal window, input the command:
sudo yum update #Note skip this command for now
The system should reach out to the software repositories and refresh the list to the latest versions.

Step 2: Install Apache
To install Apache on your CentOS server, use the following command:
sudo yum install httpd
The system should download and install the Apache software packages.

Step 3: Activate Apache
To activate Apache, start its service first.
1.	Enter the following command in a terminal window:
2.	sudo systemctl start httpd
3.	This will start the Apache service.
4.	2. Next, set the Apache service to start when the system boots:
5.	sudo systemctl enable httpd

Step 4: Verify Apache Service
	Display information about Apache, and verify it’s currently running with:
	sudo systemctl status httpd

Step 5: Configure firewalld to Allow Apache Traffic
In a standard installation, CentOS 7 is set to prevent traffic to Apache.
Normal web traffic uses the http protocol on Port 80, while encrypted web traffic uses the https protocol, on Port 443.

1. Modify your firewall to allow connections on these ports using the following commands:
sudo firewall-cmd ––permanent ––add-port=80/tcp
sudo firewall-cmd ––permanent ––add-port=443/tcp
2. Once these complete successfully, reload the firewall to apply the changes with the command:
	sudo firewall-cmd ––reload









Step 6:  Create a index file
 as root 
#cd  /var/www/html
Vim index.html  and copy paste the following or just write anything else and save

<!DOCTYPE html>
