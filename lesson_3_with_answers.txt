Note:
cadmin is used a username here


1- what does the r,w and x permissions  mean on a file 
   r allows access and view contents of a file to user.
   w allows the user to save changes to a file
   x allows the user to run a software file. example C program or a shell script.


2- can a user list the contents in a directory if he/she has a read (r) permission on the directory?
   read permission alone is not enough. User also needs a execute (x) on the directory



3- can a user create files in a directory if he/she has a write (w) permission on the directory?
   write (w) permission alone is not enough. User also needs a execute (x) on the directory


4- What are the permission contexts?
   Contexts are Owner (u) aka user, group (g) and other (o)



5- Who can modify the permissions of files/directories?
   Only the owner of the object or someone with sysadmin privileges can modify.



6- Explain the following commands
   a- chmod a+rx file1   ===> This command adds r&x permissions for all contexts.
   b- chmod go-rw file1  ===> This command removes r & w permission to group and other contexts. 
   c- chmod u=rwx file1  ===> This command sets file1 permissions for the user context to 7


7- Explain the following commands
   a- chmod 764 file1  ===> full for user, rw for group and r for others.
   b- chmod 750 file1  ===> full for user, rx for group and none for others.
  

8- What is a umask and how do you find your current umask?
   umask is the default permissions newly created files and directories obtain.
   type the umask command and you it will display your current umask 


9- If your umask is set 022, what permissions will your newly created files and directory have?
   files       ===> 666 - 022 = 644
   directories ===> 777 - 022 = 755


10- Explain the following commands
    a- chown cadmin file1               ===> assign file1 to user cadmin
    b- chown -R cadmin:sales /opt/apps  ===> assign cadmin user and group sales to recursively to /opt/apps
    c- chown -R :mktg /opt/apps         ===> assing group mktg to /opt/apps recursively. note user is unchanged.
    d- chgrp mktg /opt                  ===> assign group mktg to /opt

12-  Why does the /usr/bin/passwd command require a SUID bit set on?
     Because ordinary users will need to run (effective user) as root to change their passwords

13- What is a common use of SGID on a directory?
    Shared directories are assigned SGID bit so that all the files and directories in the shared directory
    will inherit the group ownership of the directory not the user that created it 
 

14- How to do you set a sticky bit permission on a directory using the octal method?
    chmod 1777 dir1

15- What is a benefit of using the immutable flag for a file
    Immutable flag is useful if used on critical files that don't change much
    #chattr +i file1
    #lsattr file1   (lowercase i indicates flag is set)

16- When are the Access Control Lists permissions needed ?
    ACLs are usefull when the traditional permissions don't suffice


17- Explain the following commands
    setfacl -m u:user1:rwx file1  ===> Modify the permissions of file1 and add rwx for user user1
    setfacl -b file1              ===> remove the ACL permissions
    getfacl file1                 ===> List the ACL permissions attributes of file1

18- Explain the following commands:
    groups cadmin                 ===> List the groups the user cadmin is a member of
    getent passwd cadmin          ===> Check if user cadmin exists on local or a central authentication database.
    lid cadmin                    ===> list the groups use cadmin is a member of along with group ids.
    usermod -aG wheel cadmin      ===> Add a secondry group (wheel) for user cadmin
    gpasswd -d cadmin wheel       ===> Remove user cadmin from group wheel


    
19-  In how many locations can a sysadmin change the umask
    1- Globally in 
    /etc/bashrc or /etc/profile

   2- Locally for the user in
      ~/.bashrc

   3- On the command line. This change will not persist if you logout or reboot


20-  What will be the command to make sure that no one including root can remove or write to the file /opt/important.txt 
     lsattr +i /opt/important.txt
