NOTE:
Make a snapshot of your VM or clone it.

where possible, show the commands you used.

1- Add 2 1G disks to your VM
Use Link below on how to add a disk
http://45.32.212.147/virtualbox/
download the file How_to_add_a_disk_your_virtual_machine.doc

2- Use parted or fdisk to partition the disks
3- Create a volume group named appvg on the two disks
4-  Create a Logical Volume named applv on the newly created VG.
     Size of LV should be 1.5G
5-  Create a ext4 filesystem on the LV
6-  Create a mountpoint name /apps
7-  mount the newly created LV on the /apps mountpoint
8-  Create 10 files on /apps
9-  Tar up and compress the files using gzip. 
    The name of the tar file should be appfiles.tar.gz
10- Search for the file appfiles.tar.gz using the find command and 
     then the locate command 

Bonus (I don't expect you to get this part right since we haven't yet covered):
if you have two Virtual Machines and they can ping each other, copy the compressed tarball
on the second server and untar/uncompress the tarball.
