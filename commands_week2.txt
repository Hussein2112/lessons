Review of Week 2
Lesson 4:
===========


Inode:
----------
ls -li
Metadata: Time values, permissions/ownership, block storage locations, etc

Journaling:
----------
A method by which a file system records changes that have not yet been made to the file system itself in an object called a journal.


Virtual File System:
----------
A common software interface between the Linux kernel and various real file systems.


Types of Partitions:
----------
Primary
Extended
Logical


fdisk /dev/sdc   # To partition /dev/sdc using fdisk
parted /dev/sdc   # To partition /dev/sdc using parted

Parted Options:
Select:		  Choose which device/partition to modify.
mkpart:   	  Create partition with specified file system type.
print: 		  List partition table.
resizepart:       Modify end position of partition.
rm: 		  Delete partition.
quit:   	  Exit utility


partprobe:  Updates kernel with changes to partition table.

mkfs.ext4 /dev/sd6  #Create a filesystem on /dev/sda6. sda6 partition was either  created with parted or fdisk

/etc/fstab       #Configuration file that stores device, partition, and mount info.


Device Mapping:   The process of abstracting physical storage devices into virtual storage devices.


Logical Volume Manager : Software that maps physical devices and partitions to logical volumes.


pvcreate /dev/sdd1 /dev/sde1  # Create two PVs (physical volumes)

pvremove /dev/sde1            # remove /dev/sde1


vgcreate shared /dev/sdb1 /dev/sdd1  # Create VG named shared on sdb1 and sdd1

vgdisplay #  display Volume Group Information

lvcreate -L +2G -n applv shared

Mount Point:  
---------------
An access point to information stored on a local or remote storage device.

#mount /dev/sda5 /mnt 
Loads file system into directory.
Makes file system usable.
You must specify device to mount and mount point.

#umount /finance:    
Disassociates file system from mount point.
File system must not be in use.
Example: App has a file open.


cat /proc/mounts   # This file Lists status of all currently mounted file systems

cat /proc/partitions  # Contains info about each partition.  Not a real file; part of VFS.  Column format: major, minor, #blocks name


#lsblk  
This is how find disks available to your machine
Displays info about all block storage devices.

#blkid  
Similar to lsblk command. Prints block device info in flat format. 
Includes additional info like UUIDs and file system types.  
Using lsblk -f is preferable.

#fsck /dev/sd6  
Checks integrity of file system...Most systems run fsck at boot.
Errors usually caused by power/hardware failures or improper shutdown.
Unmount file system before using fsck to prevent damage.



Absolute vs. Relative Paths
Absolute path is a specific location.
Irrespective of CWD or combined paths.
References root directory.
Starts with forward slash.
Relative path however is based on CWD (Current Working Directory).
Don't begin with forward slash.
Full absolute path not necessary.
Can contain CWD (.) and parent directory (..) indicators.

The df command displays device's:
Free space
File system
Total size
Percentage of space used
Mount point
Example:
df -Th     #Display mounted filesystems. the T shows the type and h shows the numbers in 
Human Readable format
df -h /backup/sys

The du command displays file or directory sizes.
Example:
du -s * |sort -rn -k1|head   #Sort files in this directory by size and show the top 10
du -h /backup/sys


I/O Scheduling:
The process by which the OS determines the order of I/O operations as they pertain 
to block storage devices.
Schedular types are: deadline, cfq and noop
Changing the scheduler:
sudo echo noop > /sys/block/hda/queue/scheduler

#iostat -d /dev/sda2   
Check the read write IO for the Block device /dev/sda2


#ioping -c 5 /dev/sda2   
Generates report of device I/O latency in real-time. Used for troubleshooting latency issue




Lesson 5 Review
---------------
Common Editors:
vi
Vim
Emacs
gVim
gedit
GNU nano



#vim
Invokes Vim text editor.
vi redirects to Vim.
Without an argument, command opens welcome screen.
Use vim {file name} syntax to open a file.
If no file exists, Vim creates one with that name and opens it.
Supports multiple files opened simultaneously.

The ln command:
---------------
Used to create a link to a file.
File name in one directory (link) points to file in another directory (target).
Link doesn't contain data, only reference to target.
Changes to link reflect in the target.
If you don't specify link name, it will be created in current working directory.

#ln -s file1 file2             ==> file2 now becomes a symblic link to file1 (shortcut)
#ln -s /var/www/html html      ==> html is now a symbolic link to /var/www/html

#ln /etc/passwd mypasswd       ==> mypasswd becomes a hard link to /etc/passwd. A hard link is an exact copy of original not a shortcut.


printf " Bob Jones\n 222 Pine Street\n"   ==>  Prints that string to stdout with new line characters.



Redirection:
--------------
Input redirection:
#mail -s "Subject" to-address admin@yahoo.com < Filename    ==> Email Filename to-address

STDOUT
======

cat file1 2>/tmp/err.log         ==>if cat file1 errors then send error message to /tmp/out.log
cat file1 file2 &>/tmp/err.log   ==>Send both stdout and sterr to /tmp/err.log


find /var/log -type f -size 0 -or -size +100k -mmin -30  #Search for log files that are either empty or above 100 KB, and have been updated in the last 30 minutes.
find ~ -type f -name '*.txt" |xargs chmod 755  ==> find files by extention .txt in my home directory and chmod to 755

cat /etc/passwd |tee  /tmp/mypasswd      ==> Display output of /etc/passwd in stdout but also send output to file /tmp/mypasswd



Lesson 6 Review:
==================
Managing Kernel Modules

Kernel:
The core component of an operating system.
	All other components rely on it.
	Manages file system access, memory, processes, devices, etc.
	Controls all plugged-in hardware devices.
	One of first elements to be loaded on startup.
	Remains in memory during computer's operation.
	Contains system-level commands/functions hidden from users.

Components Controlled by the Kernel:
	Filesystem Acces
	Meomry
	Processes
	Devices
	Resource Allocation




Kernels tend to divide Software running in memory into two spaces:
                                -------    ------
Kernel Space:
	Region in memory where kernel executes its services.
User space:
	Region in memory outside of kernel space.
	Includes high-level apps, background processes, system libraries, etc.
	Software in user space accesses kernel space services.
	Issues system calls.
	Provides app with resources needed to perform a task.
	Example: App calls kernel to leverage I/O for data storage writing.
	Split between spaces promotes stability and security.

Types of Kernel:
Monolithic:
	All system modules run in kernel space.
	Can interact quickly with devices.
	Large size, consumes more RAM.
	Less stable.
Microkernel:
	Runs minimum resources necessary.
	Smaller kernel space, larger user space.
	Smaller over size, consumes less RAM.
	More stable.
	Worse performance.

uname command:
uname -r prints kernel version.
uname -i prints hardware platform.
uname -a prints all.


Kenel Layers:
SCI (System Call Interface):
	Handles system calls sent from user space to kernel.
	Enables scheduling of calls and of managing multiple calls at once.
Process Management:
	Allocates execution space on processor to processes.
	Shares processor time for multiple processes.
Memory management
	Shares memory with user space resources.
	Allocates memory on request and frees it when no longer needed.
File system management
	Stores, organizes, and tracks files.
	Also supports VFS.
Device management
	Manages interface between devices and user space.
	Reads calls to devices and passes them on.


Which function is associated with the SCI layer of the kernel?
	a.Passing requests to device drivers.
	b.Sending service requests to the kernel.
	c.Allocating processor time for functions.
	d.Processing scheduling functions.
	e.Organizing files on the file system.


Which of the following accurately describe the user space? (Choose two.)
	a.It is the area of the memory where the kernel executes its services.
	b.It is the area of memory in which most high-level software runs.
	c.It is the part of the system that only logged in users can access.
	d.It is the area of memory in which background processes and low-level system libraries run.


/usr/lib           ==> Contains shared libraries and binaries for software packages. Not meant to be executed by users.
/usr/lib/modules   ==> contains modules for different kernel versions.
			Has directory named after kernel's version number.
			Modules are in subdirectories based on category.

Kernel Module Commands:
lsmod       ==> 
modinfo     ==> modinfo /usr/lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/bluetooth/btusb.ko.xz
insmod      
rmmod


modprobe:
	Used to add/remove modules from kernel.
	Can load dependent modules as well.
	Preferred over insmod and rmmod commands.
	Use -a option to add modules.
	Use -r option to remove modules.
modprobe reads the modules.dep file to identify dependencies and depmod updates the modules.dep database.
/etc/modprobe.conf is deprecated.
/etc/modprobe.d/ is used instead and contains various .conf files. Alias can be created in these files


Kernel Parameter:
sysctl command is used to view or set kernel parameters at runtime.
#sysctl -a
#sysctl -w parameter=value
/etc/sysctl.conf     ==> is the configuration file used to tune and to set security paramters for a linux kernel.

Configurable system parameter are found /proc/sys/
crypto    ==> Cryptographic services.
debug     ==> Debugging kernel.
dev       ==> Hardware devices.
fs       ==>  File system data.
kernel   ==>  Miscellaneous kernel functionality.
net       ==> Networking functionality.
user       ==> User space limitations.
vm       ==>   Virtual memory management.



Some important files in /proc
------------------------------
/proc/cmdline        ==> Options passed to kernel at boot time.
/proc/cpuinfo        ==> CPU Info
/proc/devices    ==>  List of character and block devices loaded into kernel.
/proc/filesystems    ==> List of supported file system types and any currently mounted.
/proc/meminfo        ==> Information about RAM usage.
/proc/modules        ==> Information about currently installed modules.
/proc/stat           ==> Various stats about system since last reboot.
/proc/version        ==> info about kernel and gcc etc..


dmesg command: used to examine or control the kernel ring buffer
-------------
Prints messages sent to kernel buffer during and after boot.
Device drivers send messages.
Indicates status of modules/parameters.
Diagnostic messages when there are errors.
Other kernel components can send messages too.
Message buffer can also be accessed from /var/log/dmesg
Use to look for potential issues with kernel components.
Use to validate modules are loading.


#dmesg -H |grep -i network ==>  Network Card details 
#dmesg -h                  ==> help on dmesg command
dmesg -l err               ==> errors pertaining to level error
dmesg -l warn,crit,emerg
dmesg -f kern -l warn    ==> error messages of facility kernel at level error
