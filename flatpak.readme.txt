Flatpak Summary
================
Flatpak comes preinstalled with CentOS7 and higher.
Flatpak is essentially an APPSTORE for Linux.
https://flathub.org/home

Flatpak runs in a sandbox like a container which means it is essentially OS agnostic
Flatpak requires that you initially tell it which "repository" or "HUB" to use.
The main hub for flatpak software is flathub.
Flatpak applications are GUI based and therefore requires that you have 
a Desktop like GNOME or KDE running.


Note:
To find all the applications hosted in flathub visit flathub.org
and click on the application you need and you will
find the INSTALLATION STEPS there at the bottom.



There are initially no repositories available as seen that there is no output from 
the following command.
  #flatpak remotes


Next, add flathub as a repo.
  #flatpak remote-add flathub https://dl.flathub.org/repo/flathub.flatpakrepo
  
Now you should be able to see flathub as a repo.
#flatpak remotes

To remove flathub from your repository list:
flatpak remote-delete flathub


List all the packages/Softwares available in flathub
  #flatpak remote-ls flathub

See if Visualstudio is available as software.
  #flatpak remote-ls flathub|grep -i visual

Or even better, Check as below
  flatpak remote-ls flathub visualstudio
  flatpak search flathub visual
  flatpak search *

Update all installed flatpaks if updates are available:
flatpak update
or
flatpak update com.visualstudio.code
  
Find information about visualstudio software. 
flatpak remote-info flathub com.visualstudio.code

Install visualstudio ... This will take sometime
  flatpak install flathub com.visualstudio.code


Find what flatpaks are installed:
flatpak list

Next run the flatpak we installed earlier:
flatpak run com.visualstudio.code

Update all the installed flatpaks or just one
