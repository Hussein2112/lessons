File Management
====================
touch file1 file2 file3 file4 file11 file12
ls                             #list files in the current directory. No file attributes displayed just names
ls -al                         #List all files including hidden ones and their attributes
ls -ltr                        #List all files in reverse order by time. Newest ones listed at the bottom. My favorite ls command
ls -lh                         #List all files with attributes. Show their size in Human readable format
ls -ltr /var/log               #list the files in /var/log in reverse order by time showing newest ones at the bottom.
ls -l xyz[1-3]*               #List all files with name starting with xyz1 or xyz2 or xyz3 followed by other characters.
ls -l [af]*                   #List all files that start with a or f followed by other characters.

Managing Users:
===============
useradd -c "Finance Manager" manderson                 #Add user manderson but also add a GECOS field (Comment)
useradd -e 2020/12/31   cmason                         #Add user cmason. cmason access expires on that date
useradd -s /bin/ksh susan                              #Add user susan and assing a korn shell instead of the default "Bourne Again" shell
useradd -D                                             #View default config for new users

passwd                                        #Change your current user's password 
passwd cadmin                                 #Change user cadmin's password. Must be root etc
getent passwd cadmin                          #Find out if user cadmin exists on your system. Either locally or thru Directory Services
getent group mkt                              #Find out if group mkt exists on your system. Either locally or thru Directory Services                               

chage -E 2022/12/31 susan                         #Change the expiry date of user susan to that date
chage -E $(date -d +180days +%Y-%m-%d) cadmin     #Change user cadmin expiry to 180 days from today
chage -l cadmin                                   #Show account aging information
chage -M 90 mike                                  #Set the maximum number of days (to 90) during which a password is valid
chage -m 3 mike                                   #Set the minimum number of days between password changes to 3.
chage -W 7 mike                                   #Set the number of days of warning before a password change to 7

usermod -c "User Two" user2                      #Modify  the value of the user's password file comment field
usermod –e 2020/12/31 user1                      #Modify user1 expiry date to 2020/12/31
usermod –aG sales user1                          #Adds user to group sales, keeping them in existing groups.
usermod -g sales user1                           #Change user1's PRIMARY group to  sales

usermod -l user99 user1                          #Changes User1's login name to user99

Locking user:
Either one of the following two commands can be used to lock a user account.
passwd -l user1                                #Lock user1 using the passwd command
usermod -L user2                               #Lock user2 using the usermod command

Unlock:
Either one of the following two commands can be used to unlock a user
passwd -u user1                               #unlock user1 using the passwd command
usermod -U user2                              #unlock user1 using the usermod command

userdel user1                                #Deletes user user1 but leaves home directory files as orphaned
userdel -r user2                             #Deletes user2 and his files and directories                                                          

Managing Groups:
----------------
groupadd    mkt                   #Add a new group called mkt
groupadd –g 123 sales
groupadd –f sales              # Exit with success if group already exists.
groupadd –o –g 123 sales       # Allow group creation with non-unique ID.

groupmod -g 123 sales
groupmod -n newsales sales     #Rename the group
groupdel sales                 #doesn't delete users. Just group

User Management files
---------------------
/etc/passwd      # Files were local users get created
/etc/shadow      #a text file that contains information about the users encrypted passwords and related info.
/etc/skel/     #Files and directories in this directory are automatically copied to NEW user's Home directory
/etc/profile   #Provides system-wide environment variables.
~/.bashrc      #Enables customization of user's environment., variables, aliases, Prompt ...
~/.bash_profile #Provides shell configuration for initial login. PATH etc
/etc/profile.d/  #Recommended to set variables in scripts here.  Rather than edit /etc/profile directly.

/etc/bashrc     #Provides system-wide Bash settings.  Different than /etc/profile (used for variables). Aliases, functions etc go here

A new user has been added to a linux machine. Which of the following directories would contain the users default files?
a.	/etc/login.defs
b.	/etc/passwd
c.	/etc/skel
d.	/etc/inittab



Account querying:
=================
whoami                  #Print the user name associated with the current effective user ID.  Same as id -un.
who am i                #Print The user you originally logged in as.
who                     #Determine details of users currently logged in.
w                       #Displays details of logged in users and transactions.
last                    #Display users that logged in the system.Show logged and logged out time
lastb                   #Display users with failed attempted logins. Only root is allowed to run this command
id cmason               #print real and effective user and group IDs for user cmason




Lesson 3:
Permissions:
===================

Symbolic Method
----------------
1- chmod u=rwx,g=rx,o=r myfile     #using symbolic method assign rwx for user, rx for group r for others.
2- chmod 754 myfile                #Same as above using Octal method
3- chmod -R 755 mydir1             #Recursively assign 755 permissions to mydir1 directory

4- chmod u=rw example.jpg          #Assign rw permissions to the owner of the file.
5- chmod u+s comphope.txt          #Assign SUID to file comphope.txt
6- chmod a=rw file.txt       #same as chmod 666 file.txt
7- chmod -c 744 myfile       #Report changes made to permissions.


Absolute Method:
-----------------
Binary Permissions Calculation
r     w    x
4   + 2  + 1
2^2  2^1  2^0

0 0 0  = 0 = ---
0 0 1  = 1 = --x 
0 1 0  = 2 = -w-
0 1 1  = 3 = -wx
1 0 0  = 4 = r--
1 0 1  = 5 = r-x
1 1 0  = 6 = rw-
1 1 1  = 7 = rwx


umask                    # This command will display the current umask
umask 002                # This command will set your umask to 002

umask in /etc/bashrc  		#system-wide umask
umask in /etc/profile  		#System wide umask
umask in ~/.bashrc    		#umask set per user 
umask  002            		#umask set manually on the current terminal to 002


chown root file1               #Change file owner to root
chown :root file1              #Change group file to root
chown hussein:hussein file1    #Change owner to hussein user and group to hussein group

chown --from=root:hussein hussein:root file1    #The above command will check whether the existing owner is 'root' and group is 'hussein'. If yes, then owner will be changed to 'hussein' and group will become 'root'.

chown hussein: file1
Will make sure the ownership is given to 'hussein' and the group gets changed to the login group of 'hussein'. Note that this is different from the case when colon (:) isn't used, as in that case , the group remains unchanged.

 
sudo chown -R hussein:hussein dir1 -v

chgrp root file1
chgrp -h root file1symlink


chgrp --reference=file2 file1  #Will command will make the group ownership of file1 same as that of file2.

SUID, SGID and Stick bit
------------------------
chmod 4555 [path_to_file]
chmod u+s dir1
chmod 2555 dir1    #r-xr-sr-x
chmod g+s dir2
chmod 1777 newwdir


Attribute Change:
------------------
chattr +i file1
chattr -R +i dir1
chattr -i  file1
sudo chattr +i /home/ruth/training*_doc.txt
lsattr -d dir1   #List directories like files instead of their content

ACLs
--------
getfacl file1                                       #Retrieve ACLs of file1
setfacl -m u:cadmin:rwx file1                       #Give cadmin Full permission to file1
setfacl -m u:susan:7 file1                          # Give Susan Full permission to file1
setfacl -b file                                     #Remove All ACL Entries





Lesson 11
Managing Packages:
===========================
Redhat based:
-------------
rpm -vV iperf   #v --> verbose ... V --> Verify software components of package exist.
rpm -qa nmap              #List all installed software.
rpm -qi nmap               #List information about a package.
rpm -qc httpd              # List configuration files for a package.
rpm -U httpd               #Installs and upgrades if already installed
rpm -F httpd               #Just freshens(upgrades)


yum install packagename         #install package from any configured repository.
yum localinstall  packagename   #Install package from local repository.
yum remove  packagename         #Uninstall package.
yum update  packagename         #Update package or all installed packages if no argument given.
yum info packagename            #Report info about package.
yum provides filename           #Report what package provides specified files.
yum history                     #Show a history of the packages installed




Debian based:
-------------
apt install packagename      # Install package.
apt remove  packagename      # Uninstall package, leaving behind config files.
apt purge   packagename      # Uninstall package, removing config files.
apt show    packagename      # Report info about package.
apt version packagename      # Display version info about package.
apt update                   # Update the APT database of available packages.
apt upgrade packagename      # Upgrade package or all packages if none provided.



Repositories explained
----------------------
Local:
Stored on system's storage drive.
Installation is easy, but version control difficult.

Centralized internal:
Stored on one or more systems in a LAN.
Version control is simpler.

Vendor:
Maintained on Internet.
Version control is managed by vendor.




wget & curl Examples:
-------------
wget and curl are the commands used to "Download" software from a webserver.
These two commands can NOT upload. Must use scp, rsync,sftp etc to achieve that goal.

Examples of downloading with wget and curl:
-------------------------------------------
wget http://download.samba.org/pub/samba/samba-latest.tar.gz         #Downloads the file samba-latest.tar.gz
curl -o nmap-7.70.tar.bz2 https://nmap.org/dist/nmap-7.70.tar.bz2    #Downloads the file nmap-7.70.tar.bz2 with name nmap-7.70.tar.bz2



tar
----
tar cvf file.tar file*         #creates a tar file named file.tar of all the files that start with file* in this directory.
tar czvf files.tar.gz file1    #Same as above but also compresses using gzip
tar tvf file.tar               #Shows you the contents of the tar file. Note the tar file (file.tar) is not compressed
tar tzvf file.tar.gz           # Shows you the contents of the compressed tar file


ldd:
------
ldd /bin/ls                   #Displays the shared libraries used by the command ls


Links
======
ln -s /var/log logs         #Creates a soft link called logs of /var/log
ln fila fileb               #Creates a hard link called fileb of filea
